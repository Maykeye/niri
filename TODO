[x] Edit config to support named binds group
    [?] probably K as keeping binds{} separate means we can have extra config values if needed
[x] Load them in main niri (done automatically)
[x] Switch between them in State [set_keybinding_group]
[ ] Add actions to switch between them in niri-ipc
[x] Add events to report switches via niri-ipc
[?] Hardcode overview to look for `overview` group
    [x] Use in overview in non brain rotted way (doing strcmp on each keypress is bad -- DONE strcmping on mode toggle)
