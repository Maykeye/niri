[x] Edit config to support named binds group
    [?] probably K as keeping binds{} separate means we can have extra config values if needed
[x] Load them in main niri (done automatically)
[ ] Switch between them in niri 
[ ] Add actions to switch between them in niri-ipc 
[?] Hardcode overview to look for `overview` group
    [ ] Use in overview in non brain rotted way (doing strcmp on each keypress is bad)
