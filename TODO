# Todo list

## Niri-mode
[ ] Fix: right now niri-mode.py can outlive the niri. When it happens, niri-mode scripts starts consuming CPU as crazy. It should quit.
    [ ] Or make KISS workaround with emphasis on stupid: when the second niri-mode starts, it should find existing one and SIGKILL it

## General
[ ] Add Documentation for forced-alpha branch and copy it to rice_combined
[ ] Add Documentation for keyboard_named_binds and copy it to rice_combined
[ ] Add Documentation for keycode-queue and copy it to rice_combined
[ ] Add actions to switch between binding modes in niri-ipc
    [ ] Add "password-countdown" modes with names "P3", "P2", "P1" and red background
        [ ] When P(n) starts, it waits for 1 second and switches to P(n-1).
        [ ] Instead of P0 `niri-kbd-xpaste.py` is launched, and then normal mode is activated
        [ ] Each mode has only 1 binding: Escape. It resets keycode queue and returns to normal mode
[?] Sync overview and switching state better
    [?] Don't synch at all and extend niri-mode to switch the mode outside of the niri core
        [ ] Add list-modes command
            [ ] Use it to decide if overview mode should be used in niri-mode script
[?] Hardcode overview to look for `overview` group
    [x] Use in overview in non brain rotted way (doing strcmp on each keypress is bad -- DONE strcmping on mode toggle)
[x] Edit config to support named binds group
    [?] probably K as keeping binds{} separate means we can have extra config values if needed
[x] Load them in main niri (done automatically)
[x] Switch between them in State [set_keybinding_group]
[x] Add events to report switches via niri-ipc
